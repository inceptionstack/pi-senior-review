# pi-senior-review

A [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension that automatically reviews code changes after each agent turn using a separate pi reviewer instance.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@inceptionstack/pi-senior-review
```

Or manually:

```bash
cp index.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-senior-review.ts
```

## How it works

```
Agent makes file changes (write, edit, bash)
         │
         ▼ agent_end fires
         │
         ▼ Extension detects file-modifying tool calls
         │
         ▼ Spawns a fresh pi instance (in-memory, isolated)
         │
         ▼ Sends per-file diffs + commit messages to reviewer
         │  Reviewer reads each file itself via read(path) tool
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
  LGTM    Issues found
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │      Feeds back to main agent
    │      Agent fixes → new review loop
    │       (up to maxReviewLoops)
    │
    ▼ >1 file reviewed from git?
    │
    ├── No → done
    │
    └── Yes → Architect review
              (cross-file consistency, architecture coherence)
```

The reviewer checks for:

- Bugs, logic errors, off-by-one errors, race conditions
- Security issues (injection, secret leaks, auth bypasses)
- Missing error handling
- DRY violations (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Readability and maintainability

## Configuration

Config files are loaded from two locations. **Local takes precedence over global:**

1. `cwd/.senior-review/` — project-specific config
2. `~/.pi/.senior-review/` — global defaults

All config files are optional. If missing, sensible defaults are used.

Use `/scaffold-review-files` to generate config templates.

### `.senior-review/settings.json`

| Setting            | Type        | Default                                            | Description                                                       |

| `model`            | string      | `"amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1"` | Reviewer model (`"provider/model-id"`)                            |
| `thinkingLevel`    | string      | `"off"`                                            | `off\|minimal\|low\|medium\|high\|xhigh`                          |

> **Note:** `roundupEnabled` is accepted as a legacy alias for `architectEnabled`.

### `.senior-review/review-rules.md`

Custom review rules appended to the reviewer prompt. Only include review criteria — the surrounding prompt (tools, budget, workflow, response format) is handled automatically.

```markdown
## Architecture

- All API endpoints must validate input with zod schemas
- Database queries must use parameterized statements

## Security

- No console.log in production code (use logger)
- No secrets in code — use environment variables
```

Use `/add-review-rule <text>` to quickly prepend rules, or `/senior-edit-review-rules` to open the file in pi's editor.

### `.senior-review/auto-review.md`

Override the "what to review / what not to report" section of the review prompt. The surrounding prompt (tools, budget, workflow, response format) is always included automatically.

### `.senior-review/architect.md`

Custom rules for the architect review (cross-file consistency check):

```markdown
## Architecture

- Verify module dependency graph has no cycles
- Check error handling is consistent across all modules
- Flag any TODO/FIXME comments added during fix loops
```

> **Note:** `.senior-review/roundup.md` is accepted as a legacy fallback.

### `.senior-review/ignore`

Gitignore-style patterns to exclude files from review:

```
# Skip generated files
*.generated.ts
dist/
node_modules/

# Skip specific paths
src/vendor/**
```

## UX

### Status bar (bottom of pi)

- `senior-review on (Alt+R toggle)` — idle, no pending files
- `senior-review on · will review 3 files (Alt+R toggle)` — edits accumulating
- `senior-review reviewing… [2/100] model-name (/cancel-review)` — reviewer running
- `senior-review off (Alt+R toggle)` — disabled

### Review progress widget

During reviews, an animated widget appears below the editor showing:

- ASCII art senior dev with reading glasses
- File list with active file highlighted and per-file tool usage counts
- Elapsed time, model name, loop count

### Commands

| Command                     | Description                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/review`                   | Toggle senior-review on/off                                        |
| `/review N`                 | Review the last N commits                                          |
| `/review-all`               | Review all changes (pending diff → last commit → all files in cwd) |
| `/cancel-review`            | Cancel an in-progress review (works during architect review)       |
| `/scaffold-review-files`    | Create `.senior-review/` config templates in a git repo            |
| `/senior-edit-review-rules` | Edit `.senior-review/review-rules.md` in pi's built-in editor      |
| `/add-review-rule <text>`   | Prepend a custom rule to `.senior-review/review-rules.md`          |

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key                | Default  | Configurable     | Action                                              |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Toggle shortcut    | `alt+r`  | `toggleShortcut` | Toggle senior-review on/off                         |
| Cancel shortcut    | _(none)_ | `cancelShortcut` | Cancel in-progress review                           |
| `ctrl+alt+r`       | built-in | no               | Cancel review (fallback, terminals that support it) |
| `ctrl+alt+shift+r` | built-in | no               | Full reset: cancel, reset loops, clear all state    |

> **Note:** `/cancel-review` is the recommended cancel method. It works in all terminals. Keyboard shortcuts for cancel are opt-in via `cancelShortcut` in settings because many terminals (especially iTerm2 on macOS) don't reliably send modifier key combos.

## Review loop behavior

1. Agent makes changes → review triggers
2. If issues found → agent fixes them → review triggers again
3. If LGTM → loop counter resets
4. If loop count reaches `maxReviewLoops` → stops with a warning
5. Toggling off/on with `/review` resets the counter

### Architect review

After the senior review loop reaches LGTM, an **architect review** triggers automatically when more than one file was reviewed from git across the session. No heuristics or judge gating — it always runs for multi-file changes.

The architect review:

- Checks architecture coherence across all changes
- Verifies cross-file consistency (naming, patterns, types)
- Looks for accumulated tech debt from fix loops
- Validates documentation is still accurate
- Uses tools (`read`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) to explore the full codebase

Disable with `"architectEnabled": false` in settings.

## What triggers a review

Only fires when file-modifying tools were used during the agent turn:

- `write` — new files
- `edit` — file edits
- `bash` — commands matching file operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `sed -i`, `cat >`, `tee`, `mkdir`, `echo >`)

Pure read/search turns are skipped. Non-file-modifying bash commands (`git commit`, `curl`, `aws`, etc.) are also skipped.

### Untracked (new) files

Files created via `write` that haven't been `git add`ed are detected via `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` and included in the review context, labeled as `(new file)`.

## Cancellation

You can cancel a review at any time:

- **`/cancel-review`** — works in all terminals, recommended method
- **Configured shortcut** — set `cancelShortcut` in settings if you want a hotkey
- **`ctrl+alt+r`** — fallback, works in terminals that support the key combo

Cancellation stops the current review immediately, including architect reviews. The agent continues normally.
